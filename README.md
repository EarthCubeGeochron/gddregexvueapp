# gddregexvueapp
A Vue.js App to help users navigate the GDD regex database.

## Development

The application is based on two other components, a Postgres database and a node.js/express.js API that is served to the web.  The API is primarily designed to be used by the GeoDeepDive Regex Library application, which is a single-page application deployed using Vue.js.
